The image is the overview of the HR analytics.
This dashboard consists of 4 pages, which are overview, demographic, performance tracker, and attrition.
It's a PowerBi data visualization project from DataCamp. The purpose of making this visualization is to understand what are the key factors that may impact attrition between people or the environment in the company.
It focuses on how to import, analyze, and visualize Human Resource data in Power BI. DAX was involved in building a powerful visualization.

Please feel free to look around and explore what I found with my analysis and visualization.
