The image is the overview of the HR analytics.
This dashboard consists of 4 pages, which are overview, demographic, performance tracker, and attrition.
It's a PowerBi data visualization project from DataCamp. The purpose of making this visualization is to understand what are the key factors may impact attrition between people or the environment in the company.
And it focuses on how to import, analyze and visualize Human Resource data in Power BI. It involved DAX to build the powerful visualization.

Feel free to look around and explore what did I find out with my analysis and visualization.
